# AI announcement

This month, we rolled out many AI updates as we work to make Appwrite the ultimate platform for developers. Here’s what we’ve added so far:

- New knowledge base for AI
- New third-party AI integration tutorials
- New AI-powered Function templates
- New Python ML runtime

[And there is a lot more to come](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/announcing-appwrite-new-ai-integrations).

## Python ML Runtime

We’ve introduced an exciting new Function runtime: Python ML. This new runtime overcomes the limitations of the Alpine Docker image and allows you to easily install all the libraries and tools needed for machine learning.

[Take a look at the function that trains a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow in this blog.](https://appwrite.io/blog/post/introducing-python-machine-learning-runtime)

## Building with AI Function templates

The newest Appwrite AI [Function](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/functions) templates allow you to integrate AI tools such as **OpenAI, LangChain, HuggingFace,** and many more into your app without writing additional code or managing infrastructure.

## Integrate any database type into your Appwrite project

With databases, the answer is often "it depends," but we've got you covered. We created a list of top cloud database providers and highlighted their unique features and strengths. As a bonus, we've provided Appwrite Functions to integrate each database into your project.

## Open Source Community Recognitions

This month we are excited to feature **Appwrite Migrator** by Matthew Parker aka Pingu as a part of our Monthly Community Recognitions.

PinguApps.AppwriteMigrator is a .NET CLI tool that enables a code-first approach to managing your database schema with Appwrite. It helps you sync and migrate your database schema from one Appwrite instance to another.

[Take a look at AppwriteMigrator.](https://github.com/PinguApps/AppwriteMigrator)

If you'd like to participate in next month's Community Recognitions, [join our Discord server](https://appwrite.io/discord) to showcase your project.
