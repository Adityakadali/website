# Pros and cons {% #pros-and-cons %}

| Feature / Aspect| Offset Pagination | Cursor Pagination |
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Simplicity | High | Medium to Low |
| Performance | Good for early pages, degrades with deep pagination |Consistently High |
| Data Consistency | Can be inconsistent with data changes | More consistent |
| Scalability | Good for smaller datasets | High for large datasets |
| Implementation Complexity | Low | Medium to High |
| Direct Page Access | Yes | No |

Based on the application's requirements, you can then prioritize which features/aspects are most important and make a decision accordingly.

# When to use each method {% #when-to-use-each-method %}

1. Offset Pagination
  * When you have a relatively small dataset that doesn't change frequently.
  * When you need to jump to specific page numbers.
  * When simplicity and quick Implementation are priorities.

2. Cursor Pagination
  * When dealing with large datasets
  * For real-time applications or applications with frequently updating datasets.
  * When deep pagination is expected (i.e., users navigating to very high page numbers).
  * When performance and scalability are critical.

  # Recap {% #recap %}
  * Offset pagination is straightforward and allow direct page access but can suffer from performance issues in deep pagination.
   * Cursor pagination offers consistent high performance and is ideal for real-time or large datasets.
  * Data Consistency challenges arise with offset pagination, especially with changing datasets.
  * Cursor pagination can be more complex to implement and doesn't allow easy jumps to specific pages.
  * For Appwrite, consider the dataset size, update frequency, and user navigation needs when choosing a pagination method.
